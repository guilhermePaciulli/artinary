> Binary art. It is art or not art.

As a programmer that doesn't know how to draw, whilst I admire expressions of art, I like spend some of my free time trying to make beautiful things that pleases the viewers' eyes using javascript version of Processing [p5.js](https://p5js.org).

> I decided to use javascript because it's way easier to access alternative inputs (e.g. microphone and camera) and make more interactive forms of art.

### Info

* I already added the whole library of p5.js inside the repository so we don't rely on internet to see the sketches.
* I'm not taking git flow seriously here, it's all about learning something new and experimenting it, if it comes out good I publish the sketch.
* Go ahead and try me, make a PR or fork my project, nothing is written in stone.
* To test a sketch simply run a `php -S localhost:8000` and access it from the browser.

### Disclaimer
* Some of the code isn't mine, I borrowed from a very nice guy that does some lives over the subject of Digital Art. You can find his repo [here](https://github.com/CodingTrain).
